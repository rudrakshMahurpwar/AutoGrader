# AutoGrader
AutoGrader  is an automated answer sheet evaluator powered by Sentence-BERT (S-BERT). This project leverages semantic similarity techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to compare student answers with model answers and assign scores intelligently, just like a human evaluator wouldâ€”only faster and more consistently.
